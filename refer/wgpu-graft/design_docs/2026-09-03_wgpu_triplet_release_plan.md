# Wgpu Triplet Release Plan

**Status (2026-09-03):** implementation in progress; release not ready.

This plan is the cross-repo release gate for:

- `wgpu-graft` / `grafting`
- `wgpu-scry` / `scrying`
- `wgpu-weld` / `welding`
- Mere/Inker adapter crates that prove host use of those surfaces

The release target is not "Electron/Tauri replacement" as a blanket claim. The
target is narrower and defensible: browser engines can be embedded as
host-owned `wgpu` composition surfaces on DX12, Metal, and Vulkan, with
capabilities and security posture reported honestly. Weld may ship first as
trusted-content CEF embedding while sandboxing remains an explicit later
milestone.

## Confirmed decisions

1. Graft's public safe API becomes an owned front door with an unsafe raw escape
   hatch. Descriptors that transfer OS or driver ownership are move-only. Copy
   metadata stays copyable.
2. Vulkan descriptor ownership transfers only after a successful driver import.
   The owned wrapper must close on failure or return ownership in the error.
3. DX12 shared handles may remain borrowed only in the unsafe raw boundary
   because `OpenSharedHandle` does not consume them. The safe frame path uses
   shared RAII custody (`Arc<OwnedHandle>`) to match the export cache's reuse.
4. Metal must distinguish borrowed texture pointers from retained ownership.
   Retained wrappers belong in the safe front door; borrowed raw pointers remain
   unsafe.
5. Weld gets an explicit CEF sandbox config. Use
   `CefSandboxMode::UnsandboxedTrustedContent` now, mark the enum
   `#[non_exhaustive]`, and add the real sandboxed variants when they are
   implemented. Construction and demos must spell this choice rather than
   receiving the unsandboxed mode invisibly.
6. The neutral web-surface contract assessment runs separately and does not
   gate publishing.
7. After publishing all three crates, a fresh consumer built only from crates.io
   releases must run on DX12, Metal, and Vulkan. This is the packaging proof.

These hashes anchor the findings, not the eventual release candidates. Each
phase records newer exact commits as it lands.

**2026-09-03. Dirty state:** `wgpu-graft`, `wgpu-scry`, `wgpu-weld`, `mere`,
and `genet` all reported `## main...origin/main` before this plan was written.

**2026-09-03. Published crate state:** crates.io reports `grafting` 0.5.1,
`scrying` 0.6.0, and `welding` 0.13.0. The local manifests are already bumped
to `grafting` 0.6.0, `scrying` 0.7.0, and `welding` 0.14.0.

**2026-09-03. Graft ownership blocker:** `grafting/src/lib.rs:322` documents
that `VulkanExternalImage` consumes `dmabuf_fd` and `wait_semaphore_fd`, but
`VulkanExternalImage` is `Clone + Copy` at `grafting/src/lib.rs:326` and
`TextureImporter::import_frame` still takes `&NativeFrame` at
`grafting/src/lib.rs:459`. The lower-level `VulkanDmaBufImport` path is closer
to the right shape: `grafting/src/vulkan_dmabuf.rs:195` takes the import by
value and `PlaneFdGuard` closes descriptors on error.

**2026-09-03. Weld threading blocker:** `welding/src/surface.rs:528` requires
`CefSurfaceProducer: Send`. `welding/src/linux_cef/mod.rs:119` and
`welding/src/macos_cef/mod.rs:150` have bare `unsafe impl Send` declarations.
`welding/src/windows_cef/mod.rs:154` has a Windows-specific rationale and can
remain if the trait-level `Send` requirement is removed.

**2026-09-03. Weld sandbox blocker:** `welding/src/runtime.rs:231` hardcodes
`no_sandbox: 1`, and `CefRuntimeConfig` has no public sandbox choice.

**2026-09-03. Scry capability blocker:** `scrying/src/wpe_producer/mod.rs:48`
returns a WPE capability struct whose `preferred_mode` and `imported_texture`
still say unsupported, while its reason string describes the working WPE
DMABUF path and `scrying/src/wpe_producer/producer.rs:214` installs those
capabilities into real producers.

**2026-09-03. GTK blocking bug:** the WebKitGTK and WebKit6 CPU snapshot paths
hardcode a two-second timeout at `scrying/src/webkitgtk_producer/capture.rs:35`
and `scrying/src/webkit6_producer/capture.rs:181`, despite comments naming the
configured `frame_timeout`.

**2026-09-03. Adapter contract mismatch:** Mere/Inker's
`SurfaceProducer` is deliberately not `Send`
(`mere/crates/inker/inker/src/surface_engine.rs:870`). Its `WebSurface`
contract already wants an ordered event stream
(`mere/crates/inker/inker/src/surface_engine.rs:942`), but cookies and
script-result APIs are still synchronous at
`mere/crates/inker/inker/src/surface_engine.rs:1003` and `:1035`. Weld already
exposes request/poll pairs for script results and cookies in
`welding/src/surface.rs:930` and `:958`.

**2026-09-03. Registry order gate:** Scry and Weld currently require
`grafting` 0.6.0 from a pinned Git revision while crates.io contains only
Graft 0.5.1. Their packages cannot become registry-only until Graft publishes.
`servo-wgpu-interop-adapter` has its own registry-dependency question and does
not gate the `grafting` crate publication.

**2026-09-03. Feature unification is not a release blocker:** the manifests
document that the newest enabled wgpu row wins, and Graft re-exports its
selected `wgpu` types. A consumer that also names an incompatible `wgpu` gets a
compile-time integration error, not an unchecked runtime mismatch. Clearer
diagnostics remain useful follow-up.

## Phase 1: Graft owned import API

Goal: make the safe public API impossible to misuse for consumed native
handles.

Planned changes:

- Add move-only owned wrappers for consumed Linux descriptors, including
  per-plane DMABUF fds and optional semaphore fd.
- Represent shared-allocation multi-plane DMABUF as owned buffers plus
  plane-to-buffer indices so one kernel fd cannot be closed twice.
- Change safe Vulkan import entry points to take the owned frame by value.
- Remove `Copy` from any public type that owns or may own consumed descriptors.
- Represent reusable DX12 resource custody with `Arc<OwnedHandle>` plus a
  separate allocation key for import caches. `OpenSharedHandle` creates the
  imported COM reference without consuming the exported handle.
- Represent Metal custody with a retained Objective-C texture in the safe path.
- Keep raw borrowed/scalar descriptors available under an explicitly unsafe API
  whose docs state who closes each handle.
- Make failure semantics explicit: if Vulkan import fails before ownership
  transfers to the driver, Graft closes the owned descriptors or returns an
  error carrying the still-owned frame. Pick one behavior and test it.

Done conditions:

- Unit tests prove owned fds close once on validation failure.
- A forced Windows demo import error proves cleanup is not skipped by an early
  `?`; the current import-then-close call pattern leaks on that path.
- Linux DMABUF round-trip still passes on a compatible Vulkan host.
- Public docs and changelog describe the breaking API change.
- Scry and Weld can adapt without retaining duplicate fd-close sites.

## Phase 2: Consumer ownership cleanup

Goal: remove hand-managed descriptor lifetime from producers and demos where
Graft can own it.

Planned changes:

- Update Scry's WPE DMABUF frame handoff to produce the new owned Graft input
  or a clearly borrowed raw descriptor, not a copyable consumed fd struct.
- Update Weld's Linux CEF DMABUF path the same way.
- Remove duplicate manual close logic from demos after ownership crosses into
  Graft.
- Keep producer-side stale-frame eviction closing only descriptors that have
  not been handed to Graft.

Done conditions:

- `cargo test -p grafting`
- focused Scry WPE ownership tests
- focused Weld Linux native-frame tests
- no reachable path closes a descriptor after a successful import handoff

## Phase 3: Weld threading and sandbox honesty

Goal: make the CEF producer API match the thread-affinity contract hosts
actually need.

Planned changes:

- Drop the `Send` supertrait from `CefSurfaceProducer`.
- Remove `unsafe impl Send` from Linux and macOS producers.
- Keep the Windows `unsafe impl Send` only if its documented proxying rationale
  survives `cargo check` and local review after the trait bound is gone.
- Add `#[non_exhaustive] pub enum CefSandboxMode` with the initial variant
  `UnsandboxedTrustedContent`.
- Add `sandbox: CefSandboxMode` to `CefRuntimeConfig`; the current initializer
  sets `no_sandbox` only when the mode is `UnsandboxedTrustedContent`.
- Carry the same choice through CEF's subprocess entry path; its current
  path-only signature cannot express a process-wide sandbox policy.
- Update README and runtime docs to call Weld a trusted-content embedder until
  a sandboxed mode lands.

Done conditions:

- `cargo check -p welding --no-default-features`
- `cargo check -p welding --features cef-runtime`
- Weld docs no longer imply a sandboxed production process model.
- Linux/macOS producers no longer claim cross-thread movability.

## Phase 4: Capability and timeout repairs

Goal: make probes and adapters describe actual runtime behavior rather than
hopeful defaults.

Planned changes:

- Fix Scry WPE capabilities so `preferred_mode`, `imported_texture`,
  `cpu_snapshot`, and `supported_frames` match the feature and host state.
- Make Scry capability fields one-to-one enough that adapters stop guessing
  about cookies, script, capture, devtools, downloads, popups, drag/drop, IME,
  accessibility, and degradation reasons.
- Fix WebKitGTK and WebKit6 CPU snapshot timeout handling to use
  `frame_timeout`.
- Override GTK producer non-blocking acquisition so Inker does not block and
  discard CPU frames in `scrying-engine`.
- Make Weld's capability probe account for the `cef-runtime` feature, not just
  the target OS.
- Add explicit capability tests for every changed field.

Done conditions:

- Scry and Weld capability probes have tests for feature-off and feature-on
  behavior.
- `scrying-engine` does not block inside `SurfaceProducer::acquire_frame` when
  the producer only has CPU snapshot output.
- Capability rows that are unsupported carry actionable reasons.

## Phase 5: MSRV and packaging hygiene

Goal: ensure the release can be consumed from crates.io without local checkouts.

Planned changes:

- Declare an MSRV in every published crate manifest. Start from 1.92 because
  the supported wgpu 28 row declares that floor (wgpu 29/30 declare 1.87), then
  raise it only if an exact-version build of a complete publishable feature
  graph requires more. The demo workspace's 1.97.1 pin is not the library MSRV.
- Replace Scry and Weld git-rev `grafting` dependencies with crates.io
  `grafting = "0.6.0"` after Graft publishes.
- Ensure package metadata and READMEs match the release posture. Remove
  generated-by-AI boilerplate from public crate READMEs; it is process residue,
  not useful package documentation.
- Dry-run packaging before publishing each crate.

Done conditions:

- `cargo package -p grafting` and each crate's verified publish dry-run pass
  from clean candidate commits. Package contents are inspected before upload.
- Fresh temporary consumers can resolve `grafting`, `scrying`, and `welding`
  without git dependencies.
- `cargo metadata` in those consumers shows one selected wgpu major per test
  row.

## Phase 6: Publish and prove

Goal: publish in the only order that can prove the stack.

Order:

1. Land Graft ownership changes and publish `grafting` 0.6.0.
2. Update Scry and Weld to depend on crates.io `grafting` 0.6.0.
3. Build fresh external consumers of Scry and Weld against the published Graft.
4. Publish `scrying` 0.7.0 and `welding` 0.14.0.
5. Build a fresh consumer using only the three crates.io releases.
6. Run fresh, registry-only platform harnesses on DX12, Metal, and Vulkan. The harnesses must
   record `cargo metadata`/`cargo tree` evidence that all three library sources
   are registry packages, with no Git or path override.

Done conditions:

- DX12 proof uses Windows hardware and imports a live browser frame into a
  host-owned wgpu composition path.
- Metal proof runs on both Apple Silicon and Intel Mac when available.
- Vulkan proof runs the Linux DMABUF path on the RADV host.
- Graft's Servo lane and Weld's CEF lane each pass on DX12, Metal, and Vulkan.
- Scry passes WebView2/DX12, WKWebView/Metal, and WPE/Vulkan import. Its
  WebKitGTK 4.1 and WebKit6 CPU frames are uploaded into a host-owned wgpu
  texture, or those backends are explicitly excluded from the wgpu-composition
  claim. A native child overlay does not count as wgpu composition.
- Each claimed browser path loads a deterministic local page, produces a page
  pixel, observes pointer input, resizes, and proves script/cookie behavior
  wherever its capability report says those operations are supported.
- The receipt records exact crate versions, host backend, selected wgpu row,
  hardware host, and the observed frame/pixel/input result.

## Non-gating parallel item

The neutral contract assessment lives in
`mere/design_docs/inker_docs/research/2026-09-03_web_surface_contract_assessment.md`. It should proceed
in parallel, but it does not block publishing the current Scry/Weld/Graft
releases once the release gates above are green.

## Release stop conditions

- Any ownership test shows a double-close, leak, or reusable stale descriptor.
- A platform producer still claims `Send` while its required UI-thread affinity
  is unchanged.
- A capability report says `Supported` when the selected build cannot construct
  or emit that path.
- An ordinary frame poll blocks past its non-blocking contract.
- A fresh package consumer resolves a path or Git Graft dependency.
- A registry-only hardware consumer fails a backend or transport that the
  release claims.

Crates.io versions are immutable. If a published crate proves defective, stop
the train, yank only the affected version when necessary, and issue a new patch
release. A failure in Scry or Weld is not a reason to yank a healthy Graft.

## Post-release milestones

- Implement CEF sandboxed modes for Weld and update the security posture from
  trusted-content preview to sandboxed embedding where proven.
- Decide whether to publish a neutral `surface-engine-api` crate or keep
  complete per-engine capability structs without a shared crate.
- Add a polished host-owned wgpu browser-surface demo that compares Servo,
  system WebViews, and CEF under one host UI without implying they have the same
  process model or security guarantees.

## Progress

- 2026-09-03: Plan founded in `wgpu-graft/design_docs/` after the ownership,
  sandbox, neutral-contract, and post-publish-consumer decisions were confirmed.
- 2026-09-03: Phase 1 implementation started in Graft. Safe native frames now
  carry owned Vulkan descriptors, retained Metal textures, or shared RAII DX12
  resource custody and are consumed by import. Raw borrowed imports remain
  explicitly unsafe. Windows, Linux, and Apple compile/hardware receipts and
  the required new hardware workflow run remain open; the earlier green
  hardware baseline (workflow run 33826415538, commit 12dba60b) predates this
  ownership change and is not validation for it.
- 2026-09-03: Windows local receipt for the Phase 1 slice: isolated
  `cargo check -p grafting --no-default-features --features wgpu-29 -j 1` and
  `cargo test -p grafting --no-default-features --features wgpu-29 -j 1`
  passed. The latter exercised move-only structural assertions and real Win32
  handle custody tests. wgpu-28/30 and Linux/Apple compilation plus fresh
  hardware workflow proof remain required before release.
